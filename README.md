# Numerical-Integration
 This research addresses high-dimensional nu
merical integration, which is complex and com
putationally intensive. Traditional methods are
 inefficient in high dimensions, so we use Monte
 Carlo methods with random sampling for scala
bility and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods with low
discrepancy sequences for better accuracy and
 faster convergence
